# Human-ligaments
Optimisation the parameters of ligament models.

The aim of the project is to generate code that, through the functions and variables contained in its structure, will create a programme to numerically optimise the parameters of ligament models. The project will analyse two types of models: quadratic and exponential. An important part of the project is to compare the results between the models and determine the influence of variable noise on the quality of the model. Ultimately, we will define which model better represents the waveforms typical of human ligaments.
